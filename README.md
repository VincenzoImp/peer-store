## Features in Detail

### AI-Powered Image Recognition
When users create posts, the app automatically analyzes uploaded photos using Google ML Kit to:
- Detect objects in images
- Generate confidence scores for identified items
- Provide automatic descriptions to supplement user descriptions

### Location Services
- Calculate distances between user location and posted items
- Display items sorted by proximity
- GPS integration for accurate positioning

### Real-time Chat System
- Post-specific chat rooms stored in Firestore
- Real-time message synchronization
- User identification in chat messages

### User Experience
- Clean, Material Design-inspired interface
- Bottom navigation for easy screen switching
- Image rotation handling for camera captures
- Responsive layouts for different screen sizes

## Database Schema

### Users Collection
```json
{
  "posts": ["postId1", "postId2", ...]
}
```

### Posts Collection
```json
{
  "title": "Item title",
  "image": "https://firebase-storage-url",
  "imageName": "unique-image-name.jpg", 
  "descriptionAI": "AI-generated description",
  "descriptionOwner": "User description",
  "price": "100",
  "owner": "userId",
  "latitude": 40.7128,
  "longitude": -74.0060,
  "globalChat": ["userId_message1", "userId_message2", ...]
}
```

## Security Considerations

- User authentication handled securely through Firebase Auth
- Database rules should be configured to ensure users can only modify their own data
- Image uploads are processed through Firebase Storage with proper access controls
- Location data is used only for distance calculations and not stored permanently

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Push notifications for new messages
- [ ] Advanced search and filtering options
- [ ] User ratings and reviews system
- [ ] Payment integration
- [ ] Enhanced AI descriptions with more detailed analysis
- [ ] Dark mode support
- [ ] Multi-language support
